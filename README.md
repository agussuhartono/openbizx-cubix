OpenbizX CubiX
==============

OpenbizX CubiX is fork of Openbiz Cubi.

This project aimed to increase more better code standard and application design. 
We can not perform it on original Openbiz Project because hampered by compatibility isue.

This repo initialized from Openbiz Cubi project, version r5369.

**Note:**
This project not yet have name as brand, "OpenbizX CubiX" is only as "project code". 
Maybe this project be created as next version of original Openbiz Cubi.


What's Different? 
-----------------
OpenbizX CubiX have new concept that different with original Openbiz Cubi.
- OpenbizX CubiX fully namespaced
- OpenbizX CubiX support multiple type of MetaObject
- On OpenbizX CubiX, we can use singleton object to subtitute MetaObject
 
OpenbizX CubiX not have compatibility with Openbiz Cubi :D

Openbiz Specification Request
-----------------------------
For keep quality, we create Openbiz Specification Request.
* [OSR 001 : MetaObject] (https://github.com/binexa/openbizx-cubix/blob/master/docs/osr/OSR-001-metaobject.md)
* [OSR 002 : Openbiz MVC] (https://github.com/binexa/openbizx-cubix/tree/master/docs/osr/OSR-002.md)

We are still looking for more good architecture for Openbizx Cubi.
